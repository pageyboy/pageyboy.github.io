				<h1>My Projects</h1>
				<h3>The Field Out Tool</h3>
				<p>This was my first deployed desktop application and is widely used internally within my current company.</p>
				<p>It is a ticketing system that automates contacting Field Engineers when there are no Remote Engineers available to speak to customers that contact the team to ensure that customers queries are handled effectively.</p>
				<p>Languages: VB.NET, SQL</p>
				<p>Scope: 10-15 daily users</p>

				<h3>Drop Point Calculator</h3>
				<p>Building upon the success of the Field Out Tool I wrote this simple desktop application</p>
				<p>When engineers are scheduled to attend customer sites parts are often required to fix the instruments. It is much cheaper to send parts to strategic Third Party drop points than directly to site although if the engineer has to travel a significant distance out of their way then this saving is negated.</p>
				<p>The application simply determines the closest drop points to site if the engineer is unknown or, alternatively, should the engineer be known all drop points on route are assessed and the drop point that is most convenient is chosen.</p>
				<p>Languages & APIs: VB.NET, Google Geocoding API, Google Maps Distance Matrix API</p>
				<p>Scope: Several daily users for 100+ daily engineer visits</p>

				<h3>Under Pressure - Ion Mobility Drift Gas Pressure Monitor</h3>
				<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pageyboy/UnderPressure/master/Readme%20Images/UnderPressure_Measure_Graph_750.PNG" id="project-image">
				<a href="https://github.com/pageyboy/UnderPressure" target="_blank">View this project on Github</a>
				<p>This application was developed to facilitate monitoring of the drift gas pressures related to the Agilent G6560X IM-QTOF.</p>
				<p>The current method of monitoring and adjusting drift gas pressures was a little hit and miss. A Hyperterminal connection was made and the stream of data in the Hypeterminal window was eyeballed.</p>
				<p>More exact measurements can be performed by taking the data offline and exporting to CSV followed by manually parsing data and creating the statistics or graphs as required.</p>
				<p>This tool was developed to offer a live view of these drift gas pressures and display them graphically and utilising colour coding.</p>
				<p>Languages & APIs: VB.NET, Serial Port Buffer</p>
				<p>Scope: Customers, Field Engineers, Factory Engineers</p>
