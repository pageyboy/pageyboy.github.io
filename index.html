<!--About Section-->

		<div class="section" id="About">
			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<h3>I am 30 years old and married to my lovely wife, Louise, of 5 years. We have one son, Jack, and his brother is on the way.</h3>
			<h3>I am a self taught developer and have been learning for over a decade and studying more seriously in the last 12 months. I wrote my first code in VBA to automate a repetitive task and have been hooked ever since.</h3>
			<h3>I am currently a Field Service Engineer with a Silicon Valley-based Scientific Instrumentation Company.</h3>
		</div>
		
<!--What Section-->

		<div class="section" id="What">
			<h1>What I Do</h1>
			<h3>Although happy in my role as a Field Service Engineer, I am ready to make the jump into fulltime coding.</h3>
			<h3>I have experience in the following languages:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>VB.NET</li>
				<li>Swift</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
				<li>HTML/CSS</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		
<!--Projects Section-->

		<div class="section" id="Projects">
			<h1>My Projects</h1>
			<h3>The Field Out Tool</h3>
			<p>This was my first deployed desktop application and is widely used internally within the company I work for.</p>
			<p>It is a ticketing system that automates contacting Field Engineers when there are no Remote Engineers available to speak to customers that contact the team to ensure that customers queries are handled effectively.</p>
			<p>Languages: VB.NET, SQL</p>
			<p>Scope: 10-15 daily users</p>
			<h3>Drop Point Calculator</h3>
			<p>Building upon the success of the Field Out Tool I wrote this simple desktop application</p>
			<p>When engineers are scheduled to attend customer sites parts are often required to fix the instruments. It is much cheaper to send parts to strategic Third Party drop points than directly to site although if the engineer has to travel a significant distance out of their way then this saving is negated.</p>
			<p>The application simply determines the closest drop points to site if the engineer is unknown or, alternatively, should the engineer be known all drop points on route are assessed and the drop point that is most convenient is chosen.</p>
			<p>Languages & APIs: VB.NET, Google Geocoding API, Google Maps Distance Matrix API</p>
			<p>Scope: Several daily users for 100+ daily engineer visits</p>
